# DeskMint Frontend

DeskMint is a source available web application designed to simplify workflows for small businesses, teams, and organizations. It aims to streamline client communication, document management, invoicing, and task management through a centralized platform.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the frontend for DeskMint. The frontend is built using modern web technologies, and it's intended to work seamlessly with the DeskMint backend (which you can find in the [deskmint-backend](https://github.com/parthmp/deskmint-backend) repository).

- **Vue Router** (for routing between pages)
- **Vuex** (for state management)
- **Dark Mode** (a toggleable dark/light theme)
- **Custom UI Components** (Buttons, Tables, Checkboxes, etc.)

## Features
